# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-STREAMLIT-AND-MACHINE-LEARING
Heart Disease Prediction Using Streamlit and Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project predicts the risk of heart disease in individuals using machine learning models and provides a user-friendly interface with Streamlit. Users can input personal health information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health indicators to receive an estimation of their heart disease risk.

The goal of this project is to help individuals and healthcare professionals understand the factors contributing to heart disease and take preventive measures.

Features

User input: Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Maximum Heart Rate, Resting ECG, Exercise Induced Angina, etc.

Machine learning models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classifiers

Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy user input and real-time predictions

Data visualization: Visual representation of feature importance and model predictions

Prediction output: Probability of heart disease (High / Low risk)

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Model training and evaluation)

Streamlit (Interactive web app)
